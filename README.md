Puppet Manifests for Vagrant
============================

I use these manifests to configure vagrant machines for PHP  development.

Some modules I've pulled in and modified - I've left READMEs behind in these cases.

I use these on debian squeeze, with the dotdeb repo. The base box I am using is here: https://github.com/benlumley/VagrantBoxes - it's referenced from the Vagrantfile too.
