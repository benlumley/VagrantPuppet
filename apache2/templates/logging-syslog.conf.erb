LogLevel warn

#
# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file.
# If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a <VirtualHost>
# container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be
# logged here.  If you *do* define an error logfile for a <VirtualHost>
# container, that host's errors will be logged there and not here.
#
ErrorLog syslog:local7

#
# The following directives define some format nicknames for use with
# a CustomLog directive (see below).
#
# NOTE: using %a instead of %h seems to save a full DNS lookup for every
# connection...
#
LogFormat "%a %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined
LogFormat "%a %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b" common
LogFormat "%{Referer}i -> %U" referer
LogFormat "%{User-agent}i" agent

#
# This will send the access log messages to syslog
#
CustomLog "|/usr/bin/logger -p local7.info -t apache" combined

#
# The BufferedLogs directive causes mod_log_config to store several log 
# entries in memory and write them together to disk, rather than writing 
# them after each request. On some systems, this may result in more 
# efficient disk access and hence higher performance. It may be set only 
# once for the entire server; it cannot be configured per virtual-host.
# This directive is experimental and should be used with caution.
